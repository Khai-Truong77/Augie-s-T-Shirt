                <p class="AboutUsP">
                    This is Jane. As a mother, she wanted to make her little girl Emily have the best 5th birthday in the world. Emily is a big fan of the the hit movie series "Toy Story" and wanted
                    a special shirt for everyone to wear at the Toy Story themed party. Jane was concerned about licensing issues when making her special birthday shirts, however, her fears were quickly 
                    washed away by "Augie's Custom T-shirts' Design Team". To quote Jane, the process was "easy" and she wants to let everyone know how special and easy designing a custom t-shirt can be.

                <p class="AboutUsP">
                    Tazrey is the owner of a popular bar in the Middle Georgia area and thought her bussiness could use merchindise as a way of getting the name out and providing customers a cute memento.
                    Tazrey decided to partner up with us and purchase her custom shirts in bulk. This classy bussiness woman decides on much of her designs starting with what has a high cost to reward ratio. 
                    The shirts in the Sales section are her go to. She bases her custom designs on what colors are available for sale. Depending on the stock, Tazrey will put up certain designs in her own store
                    as Limited Edition. It's great to see her happy customers walking around with our shirts and designs we've helped bring to life.
